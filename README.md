# Alzheimers_Project
This code is used to transform the PITT data set (dementia) into json files to pipe into a keras model.

The model is 3 convolutional layers with a regressor classifier as output. 

0=Dementia (with my model)
1=Control

THIS CODE NEEDS TO BE REFACTORED. PLEASE DON'T JUDGE IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
